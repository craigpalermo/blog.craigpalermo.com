This is the first post on my new and unimproved blog. Same as last time,
but I like to believe that this time I'll be able to bring more
appealing content to the table.

Here's a quick update on me. I've done as much as I can/am willing to do to
eliminate my online presence. I just needed a break for a while, and it has
helped tremendously to allow myself time to try and take stock of where I am
personally. Much of my time over the past few months has been devoted to work
and school, which I am happy to say that I'm almost finished with, barring a
course that I'm taking in June.

I've changed email addresses and providers
several times, played around with a variety of VPS services, and even got
bored enough to make the switch to Debian as an everyday desktop OS. I guess
the bottom line is that I value my privacy, which is fine, because after a
while it almost becomes like a game, trying to see how far off the grid you can
get. However, as fun as it might seem, eventually you start to realize that
you need to learn to balance anonymity with social interaction. Once you've
removed yourself completely, it becomes apparent that you've left yourself
with nothing but the assurance that no one can find you, and what does that
really mean, anyway? It only means as much as the number of people who were
actually looking in the first place.

At this point you might be wondering why, if I so value privacy, I'm writing a
blog post that's clearly tied to my true identity? My answer to that is so
I'm able to (seemingly) have an identity. Sure, there are a lot of things that
I'd like for a lot of people not to know. These things I keep hidden behind the
wall that separates me from those who know me. What you're reading is intended
to be the publicly accessible extension of my journaling. Good luck earning
ad revenue here, Facebook.
